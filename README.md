### 4Ô∏è‚É£ API Endpoints
#### Underwrite Loan Request
**POST** `/evaluate_loan`

```json
{
  "name": "Bob Williams",
  "age": 42,
  "revenue": 80000,
  "credit_score": 700,
  "loan_amount": 35000
}

```
‚úÖ **Response:**
```json
{
	"ai_explanation": "To evaluate Bob Williams' loan application, let's assess the provided data against the defined criteria:\n\n- **Credit Score**: 700\n- **Annual Revenue**: $80,000\n- **Loan Amount Requested**: $35,000\n\n1. **Credit Score**: Bob's credit score is 700, which falls within the Medium Risk category since it is between 650 and 750.\n  \n2. **Annual Revenue**: His annual revenue is $80,000, which is also within the Medium Risk range (between $50,000 and $100,000).\n\n3. **Loan Amount as a Percentage of Revenue**: To determine eligibility based on the loan amount, we calculate the percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Loan Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Loan Amount}}{\\text{Annual Revenue}} \\times 100\\right) = \\left(\\frac{35000}{80000} \\times 100\\right) = 43.75\\%\n   \\]\n   This percentage indicates that the loan amount requested is 43.75% of the annual revenue, which is between 30% and 50%.\n\nSince Bob's credit score and revenue fall into the Medium Risk category and the loan amount requested is also within the acceptable range for this category:\n\n**Decision**: Medium Risk (Conditional Approval)\n\n**Explanation**: Bob Williams meets the criteria for a Medium Risk application. The recommended action is to issue a **conditional approval** for the loan, possibly requiring additional documentation or factors to be considered before final approval.",
	"applicant": "Bob Williams",
	"loan_decision": "Conditional Approval"

  "name": "Charlie Brown",
  "age": 29,
  "revenue": 40000,
